**Toolkits for VSCode**

I think there is no need to open too many tabs of JSON online toolkits. 

This project is to collect and bring them to VSCode.

## Features

- Convert json to go struct
- Generate json from go struct
- Encode / Decode base64 text
- Get Current Timestamp, format timestamp to ISOString, parse Datetime string to Timestamp
- url encode/decode
- center editor window like emacs use `ctrl+L`
- Conversion for json and excel

## TODO

- http request client
